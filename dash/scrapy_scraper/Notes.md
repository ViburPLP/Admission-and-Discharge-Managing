 Scrapy project designed to scrape member details and export them to a JSON file. Following the export, a Django command is triggered to process the data. The architecture consists of a custom feed exporter and a streamlined pipeline, ensuring that the Django command executes only after the JSON file has been completely written.
Key Components

    Pipeline Class: ScrapyScraperPipeline
    Custom Feed Exporter: CustomFeedExporter
    Trigger Command: Django management command to process the JSON file

Given the error that scrapy.signals has no attribute feed_export_finished, we need an alternative method to ensure that the Django command is run only after the JSON file has been completely written. One effective approach is to use the Scrapy stats and FeedExporter extension to monitor the completion of the export process.

Pipelines:
    ScrapyScraperPipeline:
        This class implements the basic Scrapy pipeline structure.
        The process_item method is defined to handle each scraped item, returning the item unchanged for further processing or exporting.

    MyPipeline:
        This class can connect to Scrapy's signals.
        Currently, it establishes a connection but avoids duplicating any command execution logic, maintaining focus on item processing.

Custom_feed_exporter

    CustomFileFeedStorage:
        This class extends Scrapy's built-in JsonItemExporter.
        The constructor initializes the exporter and sets the path for the JSON file where scraped data will be saved.

    store Method:
        This method is called when the export process is completed.
        It calls run_django_command, ensuring the command executes only after the JSON file is fully written.

    run_command Method:
        This method constructs the command to run the Django management script and executes it using subprocess.call.

Workflow Summary

    Scraping Phase:
        The Scrapy spider gathers member details and processes them through the defined pipeline.

    Export Phase:
        The CustomFeedExporter handles exporting the scraped data to a JSON file.
        Once the export completes, it automatically triggers the Django command to process the JSON file.

    Data Processing Phase:
        The Django command reads the JSON file, updates or creates member instances in the database, ensuring that the latest data is accurately represented.

Command to run the Django management script

Command to run flask
    Navigate to the command's folder and run : python trigger_scrapy.py(flask app)
